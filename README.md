# ScaleGen
**ScaleGen** -- a raster image scale generator. **ScaleGen** helps you to create scale for your microscope/map/science images. It is usefull when your original image has no scale and you know exact size of the depicted item or when a scale on original image is not sufficient for your purposes. For example when you want to use more images with distinct style of scales in one article -- unified scales look always better.

By mouse you can measure parts of an drag&dropped image eg. from microscope and **ScaleGen** create automaticly raster image with scale of exactly same size for.
When you get your scale from **ScaleGen** you have to put it to final image yourself.
